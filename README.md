building seismic resilience assessment

This is an R code file for analysis of Different classification schemes-based machine learning models of building seismic resilience assessment. It compiles and runs based on the Windows system environment.

The machine learning algorithms include Randomn Forest and Support vector machine, called the "randomForest" and "kernlab" R packages programming for training and prediction, respectively.

You can quick-test this code by loading the data file "shunxu1.0.csv" I provided.

Welcome email to me jhw@cqu.edu.cn for discussing.
